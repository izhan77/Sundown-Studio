# Sundown Studio Website Clone

Original Website : https://www.sundown-studio.com/

This project is a complete clone of the Sundown Studio website, built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I recreated the original design and functionality while also adding my own features and animations to enhance the user experience.

Features: 
Locomotive Scroll: Smooth scrolling effects for a seamless navigation experience. 
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): Advanced animations to create a dynamic and interactive interface.

This project showcases my front-end development skills and my ability to implement popular JavaScript and CSS libraries. Feel free to explore the code, and any feedback is appreciated!
